# E-CommerceCDstore
Online cd Store 

This project follows the MVC pattern.
The Web Services, OrderProcess and ProductCatalog interact with agentDB to fetch the data from the database.
The controller then manipulates the model and presents it to the user in the form JSP depending on the request that was posed by 
the user to the controller
